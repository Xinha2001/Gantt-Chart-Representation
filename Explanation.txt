Explanation and Improvements:

Dynamic Task Addition: The JavaScript function addTask() facilitates the dynamic inclusion of multiple tasks within the form interface.

SVG Chart Styling: Utilizing SVG for visualization, the Gantt chart exhibits tasks in Bootstrap's primary color and highlights dependencies in red, accompanied by directional arrows for clarity.

Content-Type Header: Preceding SVG rendering, the PHP script establishes the Content-Type as text/html to ensure optimal display compatibility within web browsers.

These enhancements yield a comprehensive solution comprising a user-friendly data input form, seamless dynamic task addition functionality, and the generation of a visually captivating Gantt chart with highlighted dependencies. This solution effectively meets all specified requirements and ensures a refined output suitable for interviews or professional presentations.
